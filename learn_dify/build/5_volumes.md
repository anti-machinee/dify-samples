# Components
## Named volumes
- used for persistent storage, ensuring that data remains intact even if the containers using them are restarted or removed. These volumes are managed by Docker and can be used by any service.
### oradata
- Containers use
    - oracle
### dify_es01_data
- Container uses
    - elasticsearch
## Mount volumes

A service cannot use a volume unless it is explicitly listed inside its volumes: section
- Containers use
    - api
    - worker
    - db
    - redis
    - sandbox
    - ssrf_proxy
    - certbot
    - nginx
    - weaviate, qdrant, couchbase-server, pgvector, pgvector-rs, chroma, oceanbase, oracle, etcd, minio, milvus-standalone, opensearch, opensearch-dashboards, myscale, elasticsearch, unstructured
